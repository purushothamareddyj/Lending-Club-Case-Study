## General Information
-->This project involves analyzing data from Lending Club, a consumer finance company specializing in lending various types of loans to customers.
  
-->The main business problem is to minimize the risk of financial loss by identifying risky loan applicants who are likely to default.

-->The dataset includes information about past loan applicants and whether they defaulted or not.

## Business Understanding
The Lending Club case study involves understanding the risk analytics in banking and financial services. By analyzing the provided loan data, we aim to develop a basic understanding of how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## Business Objectives
-->The company, being the largest online loan marketplace, wants to:

-->Identify risky loan applicants to reduce credit loss.

-->Understand the driving factors behind loan default.

-->Utilize the insights for portfolio and risk assessment.

## Loan Decision Scenarios
1.Loan Accepted: This can further result in:

	Fully Paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan.
 
	Current: Applicant is still paying the instalments.
 
	Charged-off: Applicant has defaulted on the loan.
 
2.Loan Rejected: No transactional history is available for these applicants.

## Technologies Used
-->Python - version 3.10.12

-->Pandas - version 2.2.2

-->Matplotlib - version 3.8.0

-->Seaborn - version 0.13.2

-->NumPy - version 0.13.2

## Conclusions
Higher Debt-to-Income ratios are strong indicators of potential default.

Lower credit scores correlate with increased default risk.

Larger loan amounts require careful consideration and assessment.

Employment length and loan purpose significantly influence default probability.

Interest rates need to be balanced to avoid increasing default rates while managing financial risk.
